# Countinator App
Countinator is a simple counter app build for learning purposes, aiming to delve into vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Through this project, I focused on fundamental JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation and event handling, while leveraging the simplicity of Tailwind CSS for styling. Features include incrementing and decrementing count value with toast messages for user feedback. Moving forward, potential enhancements may involve improving accessibility, adding customization options, and exploring advanced JavaScript techniques.

## Requirements
- Node.js v20.10.10
- TailwindCSS v3.4.3
